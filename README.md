# Mini Projects

A collection of Python mini-projects designed to practice core programming concepts, improve code quality, and showcase development skills.  

This repository is a curated collection of small Python projects that focus on learning through building.  
Each project is designed to be simple in scope yet complete in execution, with clear documentation, modular code, and professional repository structure.  

The goal is not to reinvent the wheel, but to strengthen core programming skills, experiment with different problem-solving approaches, and build a portfolio of reliable and well-documented practical projects.
