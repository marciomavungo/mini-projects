        <p><strong>Lyrics</strong></p>
        <pre>
                I walked across an empty land
                I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
                I felt the earth beneath my feet
                Sat by the river and it made me complete
                
                Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
                I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
                So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
                I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
                
                I came across a fallen tree
                I felt the branches of it looking at me
                Is this the place we used to love?
                Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?
                
                Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
                I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
                So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
                I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
                
                And if you have a minute, why don't we go
                Talk about it somewhere only we know?
                This could be the end of everything
                So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
                
                Somewhere only we know
                Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?
                I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on
                So, tell me when you're gonna let me in
                
                I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin
                And if you have a minute, why don't we go
                Talk about it somewhere only we know?
                This could be the end of everything
                
                So, why don't we go?
                So, why don't we go?
                Ooh, oh-oh
                Ah, oh
                
                This could be the end of everything
                So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?
                Somewhere only we know
                Somewhere only we know
